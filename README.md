Please read this file carefully for the web app to properly work:

First: create a file named 'config.json' in the src folder.

Next, in the config.json file, paste the following code:
{
    "openai": {
        "apiKey": "YOUR API KEY"
    }
}

Then, go to OpenAI's page and generate a API token. Paste it in the config.json where it states "YOUR API KEY"

The project is now good to go!
